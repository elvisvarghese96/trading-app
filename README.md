Connects to Polygon.io REST API
Fetches all active stock tickers
Handles pagination (retrieves multiple pages of data)
Extracts structured fields (ticker, name, market, exchange, type, etc.)
Saves results into a CSV file for analysis

Tech Stack

Python
Requests (for API calls)
dotenv (for API key management)
CSV module (to write structured data)

Load the Polygon API key from a .env file
Call the /v3/reference/tickers endpoint to fetch stock tickers
